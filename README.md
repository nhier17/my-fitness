# My Fitness

## Description
My fitness is a comprehensive fitness application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides users with tools for planning and tracking their workouts, accessing meal plans, and connecting with other fitness enthusiasts.

## Getting Started
To get started with my fitness, you can visit our website to sign up and create an account. Once registered, you'll have access to all the features our app has to offer
. Additionally, you can also clone the repository from GitHub and set up the app locally for development or testing purposes.

## Features
### 1. Workouts
    Create custom workout plans tailored to your fitness goals.
    Track your progress and performance over time.
    Access a library of exercises with detailed instructions and videos.

    Participate in challenges and competitions to stay motivated.
    Join groups based on specific interests or fitness levels.
    In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
